"""This addon's own lyrics window, for skins that draw none themselves.

Everything here runs on the service thread, callbacks included: Kodi delivers
onInit and onAction inside the thread's xbmc.sleep and waitForAbort calls.
Callbacks must stay trivial -- measuring from onInit crashes Kodi -- so
measuring happens in refit(), called from the service loop.

Kodi can close this dialog itself, freeing the controls behind our wrappers,
and a write through a freed control crashes Kodi. Every control write checks
_alive() first.
